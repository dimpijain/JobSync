# JobSync
An AI-powered job screening system that automates the process of shortlisting candidates by intelligently matching resumes with job descriptions. Using advanced NLP techniques, the platform parses unstructured resumes and job listings, extracts key entities like skills, experience, and education, and semantically evaluates their compatibility through a smart scoring algorithm. The system ranks candidates based on relevance and provides transparent, explainable insights for each match, helping recruiters make faster, fairer, and more informed hiring decisions.
